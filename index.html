                <p>
                    John Warwicker’s website is a reflection of his creative identity, blending minimalist
                    design with bold visual elements. The site stands out with its striking use of typography
                    and colour. Bold fonts paired with a restrained colour palette create a dynamic, yet simple
                    layout. The website is designed to invite exploration, with a focus on space and balance,
                    ensuring that each element, whether text or image, commands attention without overwhelming
                    the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site takes a more experimental approach. Rather than following traditional website
                    structures, it encourages users to engage with content in a non-linear fashion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a coding perspective, the simplicity of the design belies the complexity of the site’s
                    functionality. The site likely uses a grid-based framework; the interactive elements, such
                    as smooth animations and hover effects, are likely powered by JavaScript, providing fluid,
                    intuitive user interactions that enhance the overall experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, Warwicker’s website strikes a balance between creativity and usability. It feels
                    personal and artistic, with each design decision contributing to the overall aesthetic.
                    The coding silently supports this vision, ensuring fluidity and responsiveness across devices.
                </p>

                <h2 id="dark-mofo">Dark Mofo</h2>
                <p>
                    Exploring the Dark Mofo website, I was immediately drawn in by its bold, moody aesthetic.
                    The use of intense red and black tones, paired with striking imagery and large fonts,
                    perfectly captures the festival’s dark, immersive nature. The design is minimal yet powerful,
                    with small details like background transitions adding to the eerie atmosphere. Despite the
                    intensity of the visuals, the site maintains a sense of balance, ensuring readability and usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The navigation is surprisingly straightforward, which I found to be a smart choice. It contrasts
                    with the experimental design, making the site easy to explore while keeping the user grounded.
                    This allows the dramatic visuals to be the main focus without compromising functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a coding perspective, despite the heavy visual elements, the site performs smoothly across
                    devices, suggesting good coding practices. I appreciated how well the design and technical aspects
                    worked together, creating an engaging, seamless experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the Dark Mofo website blends bold design with solid technical performance, aligning
                    perfectly with the festival’s experimental identity while delivering a user-friendly experience.

                <h1>Reflections</h1>
                <h2 id="paper-prototype">Paper Prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose the phrase ‘the net is anarchic and subversive’ and made a concrete poem of it.
                    As seen, the visual arrangement of the words convey meaning. The words cascade and shift to create
                    a chaotic and unpredictable pattern, reflecting the chaotic nature of the internet. The phrase
                    "the net is anarchic and subversive" also suggests that the internet is a space of disorder and
                    disruption. My paper prototype is meant to represent these ideas visually and interactively. The
                    prototype
                    includes a piece of paper with a majority of the phrase written down, along with strips of paper
                    weaved into it to create moving elements that ‘reveal’ the hidden words when interacted with. This
                    is to simulate the unpredictable and fluid nature of the internet. There is a mouse that the user
                    can
                    use to move a cursor to interact with the blue and green buttons to ‘reveal’ the hidden words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on my experience with paper prototypes, I’ve realised just how valuable they are in the
                    design
                    process. Working with something as simple as paper allowed me to strip back all the bells and
                    whistles
                    and really focus on the core functionality of my design. It forced me to think about the user’s
                    journey
                    in a way that digital tools sometimes overshadow with their complexity. I was able to quickly sketch
                    ideas, test them, and then easily make changes without worrying about the technical side of things.
                    This freedom to explore and fail early on has been a game changer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest takeaways for me was how paper prototypes encouraged rapid iteration. In a matter
                    of
                    minutes, I could completely rework the layout or flow based on feedback or a fresh idea. The
                    simplicity
                    of the medium made it easy to tweak things, which really opened up more opportunities for
                    creativity.
                    It taught me not to get too attached to any one design early in the process, which in turn made me
                    more
                    open to new ideas and directions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User testing with paper prototypes has been especially eye-opening. Seeing how people interact with
                    a
                    design in its most basic form showed me where potential problems might arise, even before moving to
                    a
                    digital version. It’s one thing to imagine how users might behave, but quite another to watch them
                    fumble
                    or navigate naturally through the prototype. I learned how crucial it is to gather user feedback
                    early
                    that I might have overlooked if I went straight to a high-fidelity design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, working with paper prototypes has reinforced the importance of focusing on functionality
                    first.
                    It’s so easy to get caught up in the aesthetics of a project, but these prototypes reminded me that
                    if the
                    core experience doesn’t work, no amount of visual polish can save it. This approach has made me a
                    more
                    thoughtful, user-centred designer, and I’ll carry these lessons forward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My webpage is an interactive visual experience that is further developed based on the quote,
                    "The net is anarchic and subversive", which was the text for my paper prototype. The design
                    dynamically engages
                    users by presenting a blend of chaotic and orderly elements, reflecting the unpredictable and
                    free-flowing nature
                    of the internet. Users are invited to explore the webpage by interacting with various elements such
                    as clicking,
                    hovering, and moving the mouse which causes letters to move or fly out, offering a sense of motion
                    and transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The visual focus shifts between two distinct background images featuring iconic characters (Jhin and
                    Yasuo) from
                    the game League of Legends, which can be toggled by user action. Additionally, certain keywords in
                    the displayed
                    quote, "anarchic" and "subversive," trigger deeper insights by revealing contextual definitions. The
                    typography is
                    randomised, with text sizes, fonts, and colours varying across letters, adding a sense of creative
                    chaos in a way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In building this webpage, my goal was to reflect on the dual nature of the internet as both a space
                    of freedom and
                    disruption. The quote, "The net is anarchic and subversive," encapsulates the tension between the
                    endless opportunities
                    of online spaces and the challenge of order in a seemingly chaotic environment. Through the
                    interactive elements,
                    I wanted users to experience a sense of this unpredictability such as letters scattering upon
                    hovering and then
                    realigning, while important words remain grounded, representing the core ideas in the chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project allowed me to explore the use of arrays, conditional statements, and interactive
                    elements in JavaScript
                    to manipulate visuals in real-time. One of the most rewarding aspects was the implementation of
                    mouse events to trigger
                    animations, such as letters flying out when interacted with. I feel this gave the webpage a fun but
                    controlled interaction,
                    reacting to user behaviour and enhancing the immersive experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The choice of background images and the thematic connection to characters like Jhin and Yasuo from
                    League of Legends
                    offered a nod to chaos and order. Jhin being methodical and Yasuo representing freedom, symbolising
                    the complex dynamic
                    I wanted to capture. This project also deepened my understanding of balancing aesthetics with
                    functionality, ensuring the randomness of font changes did not interfere with readability but rather
                    enhanced the chaotic essence of the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the webpage's structure serves as both an artistic and coding exercise, pushing me to
                    think about how visuals, interactivity, and user engagement can all merge to convey a thematic
                    message.

                    This logic showcases how the character toggle works. By clicking on the character's respective
                    weapon at the top of the screen, the character swaps to the corresponding one, and the weapon image
                    updates accordingly.

                    In this logic, when double-clicked, all the letters fly back to their original location, effectively
                    resetting the layout. Additionally, the 'recall' image briefly appears during the double-click
                    interaction, providing visual feedback for the reset action.

                    In the context of the website I’ve been working on, arrays have been incredibly useful for
                    organising and manipulating data. For instance, in the code, I used arrays to store letters,
                    making it easier to manage and manipulate each character individually. The flexibility of arrays
                    allowed me to keep track of every letter's position, size, and colour, ensuring a smooth display
                    and interaction for users.

                    String manipulation played a crucial role, especially when splitting the initial quote into
                    individual
                    words and characters. By using the <code>.split()</code> function, I could break down a string into
                    manageable
                    pieces, which allowed for more control over how each word and letter is displayed on the canvas.
                    This manipulation
                    of text enabled me to create dynamic effects that react to user input, adding an interactive element
                    to the project.

                    For loops were indispensable throughout the project. They allowed me to iterate over each letter and
                    word,
                    applying transformations and animations efficiently. Whether I was arranging letters on the screen
                    or updating
                    their positions in real time, the loops ensured that the code was both concise and scalable,
                    allowing for easy
                    adjustments as the project evolved.

                    The use of if-else statements was key in making decisions within the code. For example, when users
                    click or hover
                    over specific letters, the if-else statements helped determine whether to trigger certain
                    animations, such as making
                    letters fly out of position or centering a particular word. This control logic added depth to the
                    interaction, making
                    the website more responsive to user actions.

                    Lastly, dictionaries were useful for mapping words to their definitions, as seen in the
                    <code>newQuotes</code> object.
                    This allowed me to quickly reference and display the meaning of key words like "anarchic" and
                    "subversive" when users
                    interact with them. Using a dictionary kept the code clean and organised, making it easy to manage
                    and expand the content
                    over time.

                <h4>Studio Arcade</h4>
                <div class="portrait-pictures">
                    <img src="data/studio1.jpg" alt="Studio Arcade Prototype Image 1">
                    <img src="data/studio2.jpg" alt="Studio Arcade Prototype Image 2">
                </div>
                <p>
                    During week 1 of the studio class, my group and I created a paper arcade game prototype, inspired by
                    the classic
                    Pac-Man arcade game. The project involved cutting out shapes to form the maze, movable characters,
                    and the iconic
                    elements of Pac-Man and the ghosts. The interactivity was achieved through sliding mechanisms that
                    allowed the
                    characters to move within the maze, giving a sense of gameplay and movement without the need for
                    digital components.
                    This tangible, hands-on creation captured the essence of the arcade game in a simplified form,
                    encouraging players to
                    engage physically with the elements. In our studio, we gathered around the prototype, observing how
                    people interacted
                    with it, and it was fascinating to see how such a simple model could spark discussions on movement,
                    user experience,
                    and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience reinforced the value of paper prototypes in the design process. By constructing a
                    low-fidelity version
                    of a concept, we were able to quickly test out ideas, understand spatial relationships, and gather
                    feedback from others.
                    Paper prototypes, like this arcade game, serve as a critical tool in the early stages of design.
                    They allow for iterative
                    adjustments without the need for costly or time-consuming digital development. By working with
                    physical materials, you
                    can better understand scale, user interaction, and how elements might function in real life. This
                    form of prototyping
                    also facilitates collaboration, as others can easily visualise and interact with the concept,
                    offering insights and feedback
                    that are vital to refining the design. It’s a playful and practical way to explore the possibilities
                    before committing to
                    more complex mediums.

                <h4>Interpret Drawings As Machines</h4>

                </div>
                <p>
                    During week 2 of the studio class, we engaged with the idea of interpreting drawings as machine
                    instructions, translating
                    visual elements into a set of precise commands that could be understood by a machine. The process
                    began with a simple sketch
                    of a face made up of geometric shapes, triangles, rectangles, and circles, along with annotations
                    specifying the mathematical
                    instructions necessary for their creation. The notations included details such as the x and y
                    coordinates, the sizes of the
                    shapes, and reflections along the axis. This approach pushed me to think of drawings not only as
                    visual representations but
                    also as codes that can be executed step by step to create a digital equivalent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This exercise highlighted how design and code often intersect. While design typically relies on
                    intuition, creativity, and
                    a sense of form, coding demands precision, logic, and structure. In this case, the drawing had to be
                    broken down into a series
                    of logical steps, much like how a computer program operates. The process involved analysing each
                    shape in terms of its
                    dimensions, its relation to other shapes, and its positioning in a Cartesian coordinate system. By
                    doing so, I could essentially
                    “instruct” a machine to replicate the drawing with exact accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I found particularly interesting was how this exercise made me more aware of the importance of
                    clarity and precision in
                    both design and code. When creating visual work by hand, it’s easy to overlook the fine details, but
                    when those details must
                    be communicated as machine-readable instructions, every line and position matters. This taught me to
                    view design through a more
                    technical lens, where even the smallest change can affect the outcome.

                <h4>Concrete Poetry</h4>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="data/concrete.jpg" alt="Concrete Poetry Example">
                </div>
                <p>
                    During week 3 of my studio class, we experimented with concrete poetry. I chose to focus on the
                    phrase "An error has been detected
                    in your consciousness. All source-codes are corrupt. Continue?" This text represents a blend of
                    digital and human elements, using the
                    language of programming and error detection to metaphorically comment on the nature of human
                    awareness and thought. The layout of the
                    text reinforces the sensation of an error or disruption, with the repetition of "consciousness" and
                    "corrupt" driving home the theme
                    of malfunction. In this way, the work invites reflection on our increasingly intertwined
                    relationships with technology and its impact
                    on our perception of self.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of concrete poetry ties closely to design in its ability to use form to communicate
                    meaning. The way the words are arranged
                    on the page is just as important as the words themselves, merging visual design with literary
                    content. This exercise pushed me to think
                    about how text can transcend its linguistic function and become a visual element in design. In this
                    case, the repetition of phrases and
                    the compact, uniform style reflect both the rigidity and fragility of digital systems and how those
                    same ideas might apply to human cognition.
                    This merging of code and consciousness creates a poetic critique of how dependent we have become on
                    technology, and how that dependency might
                    be affecting our mental and emotional frameworks.
                </p>

                <h4>Instructional Drawings and Crazy 8</h4>

                <p>
                    During week 4 of my studio class, we did instructional-based drawings as a method to simulate how we
                    input instructions when coding.
                    The experience was eye-opening, as it involved translating visual ideas into clear, step-by-step
                    directives that could be interpreted
                    both by a machine and a human. This exercise challenged me to think about clarity and
                    precision—qualities that are essential in both
                    design and coding. In the same way that machines require exact commands, instructional drawings
                    necessitate well-thought-out details
                    that leave little room for ambiguity. I found myself questioning not just how I draw, but how I
                    communicate a process visually, ensuring
                    that someone else could replicate the steps without confusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simultaneously, we worked on crazy 8 ideas, which encouraged rapid brainstorming and ideation. In
                    just eight minutes, we had to come up
                    with eight different ideas, pushing the limits of creativity and quick thinking. The constraint of
                    time forced me to let go of perfectionism
                    and embrace spontaneity, a valuable reminder that not every idea needs to be fully formed in the
                    early stages. This fast-paced ideation
                    process is akin to how coding sometimes involves trial and error, where you test out ideas, discard
                    the ones that don’t work, and refine
                    the ones that do.
